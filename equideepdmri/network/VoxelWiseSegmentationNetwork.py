            If this param is a single int, then the same kernel size is used for all layers.
            Else a list of integers is expected, containing one value (the kernel size)
            for each pq- and each p-layer.
        :param pq_kernel: Dict containing parameters for the kernel of the pq-layers
            (only an entry for the key "kernel" is required):

            - kernel (required): Which filter basis to use in this layer.
              Valid options are:

              - "p_space": to use the p-space filter basis
                using only p-space coordinate offsets in the angular and radial part.
              - "q_space": to use the q-space filter basis
                using only q-space coordinate offsets in the angular part
                and q-space coordinates from input and output in the radial part.
              - "pq_diff": to use the pq-diff filter basis
                using difference between p- and q-space coordinate offsets in the angular part
                and p-space coordinate offsets, q-space coordinates from input and output in the radial part.
              - "pq_TP": to use the TP (tensor product) filter basis
                using the tensor product of the p- and q-space filters in the angular part
                and p-space coordinate offsets, q-space coordinates from input and output in the radial part.
              - "sum(<filters>)": where <filters> is a ";"-separated list (without spaces) of valid options for kernel_definition,
                e.g. "sum(pq_diff;p_space)" or "sum(pq_diff;q_space)". This uses the sum of the named basis filters.
              - "concat(<filters>)" where <filters> is a ";"-separated list (without spaces) of strings "<output_channels>:<filter_type>"
                where <output_channels> lists the channels of each order where the named filter is to be used
                (e.g. "[3, 4]" to use it for 3 scalar and 4 vector output channelw) and
                <filter_type> names a valid kernel_definition to use for these output channels.
                The number of all concatenated channels needs to math type_out.
                Example: "concat([3,4]:pq_diff,[5,2,1]:p_space)" which would require type_out = [8,6,1]

            explicitly after parameters of this nn.Module have been updated.
        :param checkpointing: Whether to use use gradient checkpointing (default False).
            If True, checkpointing is applied after each layer,
