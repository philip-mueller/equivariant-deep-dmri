        :param type_in_out: The spherical tensor type of the input and output feature map (the type is the same).
            This defines how many channels of each tensor order the input/output feature map has.
            It can either be given as SphericalTensorType object or as List[int]] the element at index i of the list
            defines the number of order-i channels,
            e.g. the first element defines the number of order-0 (scalar) channels
            and the second the number of order-1 (vector) channels and so on.
            For all orders corresponding to out-of-range indices the number of channels is 0.
        :param q_sampling_schema_in: The q-sampling schema of input feature map.
            Note that there is no output q_sampling_schema as q-space is reduced.
            Note that Q_in is not explicitly given but derived form the length of this parameter.
        :param q_radial_basis_type: The radial basis function type used for weighting q-space lengths.
            Valid options are "gaussian" (default), "cosine", "bessel".
        :param q_radial_basis_params: A (optional) dict of additional parameters for the radial basis function used for q-space.
            Valid keys in this dict are:

            - num_layers: Number of layers in the FC applied to the radial basis function.
              If num_layers = 0 (default) then no FC is applied to the radial basis function.
            - num_units: Number of units (neurons) in each of the layer in the FC applied to the radial basis function.
              No default, this parameter is required and must be >0 if num_layers > 0.
            - activation_function: activation function used in the FC applied to the radial basis function,
              valid are "relu" (default) or "swish"
        :param auto_recompute:
            Whether to automatically recompute the kernel in each forward pass.
            By default it is recomputed each time.
            If this parameter is set to false, it is not recomputed and the method recompute() needs to be called
            explicitly after parameters of this nn.Module have been updated.
